Changes in version 2.0a17:
-------------------------
MASSIVE Backwards compatibility breaking change. API moved to its own package. Database completely refactored.

If you have installed a version prior to this one, and are now installing this or subsequent versions in the same virtual environment, you will need to manually delete your database. 

run `pip uninstall t2wml-standalone` 

You should see a list of files that will be removed, followed by:

> Would not remove (might be manually added):

> {ENV DIR}\lib\site-packages\backend\app.db

where {ENV DIR} is your environment directory

if you do not remove the app.db file, then you will get the following fatal error message when attempting to launch the t2wml server:

> ERROR [root] Error: Can't locate revision identified by 'a19320d46380'


Changes in version 2.0a16:
-------------------------

   - display cells with errors in qualifier in preview window
   - warn user about errors in download but download anyway
   - treat None in cell[] or item[] as a bug that causes a qualifier to be errored
      - (possible fix to empty qualifier cell bug (needs to be verified))
   - if a qualifier has no Value and is not a coordinate, treat as fatal error in qualifier.
        

Changes in version 2.0a14:

* json format changed from list of dicts to dict
* cell-specific errors when parsing template no longer raise error and exit.
  instead, they are added to a dictionary of errors, which is both printed to stderr and returned in the results
     * the only exception is errors in the first cell of the data, as that cell is used to verify validity of the template itself, and will immediately exit with error if invalid
* performance improvements to uploading property files
* performance improvements to calculating statements and to downloading kgtk results
* bug fixes:
   * 500 error when uploading properties file in json format
