# T2WML tutorial Overview

This document provides an overview of the different functionalities of T2wML by pointing to concrete examples.

The `properties.tsv` and `wikifier.csv` files present in this folder are common to all the examples and should always be loaded in T2WML.

The `region`, `time` and `qualifier` folders contains all the individual examples that are part of the tutorial. In each folder there is a combined spreadsheet that aggregates each file in different tabs.
