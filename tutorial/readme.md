# T2WML tutorial Overview

This document provides an overview of the different functionalities of T2wML by pointing to concrete examples.

The `properties.tsv` and `wikifier.csv` files present in this folder are common to all the examples and should always be loaded in T2WML.

The `spreadsheets` folder contains all the individual examples that are part of the tutorial. The file `combined.xslx` aggregates them all in a single excel spreadsheet in different tabs.

The `yaml` folder contains the T2WML files corresponding to each spreadsheet (they have the same number in the file name)

The `annotated_spreadsheets` folder contain all the examples annotated with headers to automate the creation of the yaml files.

The `annotated_yaml` folder contains the solutions for the examples in the `annotated_spreadsheets` folder
